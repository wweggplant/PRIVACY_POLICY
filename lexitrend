# Privacy Policy for LexiTrend

**Effective Date:** October 17, 2024

Thank you for using LexiTrend ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and protect it, and your choices regarding your information when you use our Chrome extension.

This policy is designed to be simple and transparent. Your privacy is important to us.

### Information We Collect

Our extension is designed to be privacy-focused. We only access or collect information that is essential for its core functionality.

1.  **User-Provided Information:**
    *   **API Keys:** To use the extension, you must provide your own API key for Google's Gemini service. You may also optionally provide an API key for Tavily Search to enable enhanced features. These keys are sensitive credentials.

2.  **Usage Data:**
    *   **Selected Keywords:** The extension processes the keywords you select on the Google Trends website. This is the primary data used to provide the analysis.

We **do not** collect any other Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or browsing history outside of the Google Trends domain.

### How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide Core Functionality:** Your API keys are used to authenticate requests with the respective third-party services (Google Gemini, Tavily). The keywords you select are sent to these services to generate the analysis you see in the side panel.
*   **To Store Your Configuration:** Your API keys are stored locally on your computer using the `chrome.storage.local` API. This allows you to use the extension without re-entering your keys every time. **We never transmit your API keys to our servers.**

### Information Sharing and Third-Party Services

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties, except as described below:

*   **Google Gemini API:** To provide the analysis, the keywords you select are sent to Google's Generative Language API. We recommend you review Google's API Privacy Policy for information on how they handle data.
*   **Tavily Search API (Optional):** If you provide a Tavily API key, selected keywords may also be sent to the Tavily Search API to gather real-time information.

Your API keys are sent directly from your browser to these services and are not routed through our servers.

### Data Security

We take the security of your information seriously.

*   **Local Storage:** Your sensitive API keys are stored exclusively on your local machine using the secure `chrome.storage.local` API. They are not accessible to us or any other website.
*   **Data Transmission:** All communication with third-party APIs is conducted over HTTPS, which encrypts the data in transit.

### Data Retention

We do not retain any of your personal data on our servers. The keywords you analyze are sent to third-party APIs for immediate processing and are not stored by the LexiTrend extension itself. Your API keys are stored on your local device until you uninstall the extension or clear them manually.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
